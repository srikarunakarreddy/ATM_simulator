🏦 ATM Simulator (Python CLI Project)

A beginner‑friendly Python project that simulates basic ATM operations. Built to practice loops, conditionals, and functions, while also demonstrating clean modular design and transaction tracking.

✨ Features

✅ Check account balance

💵 Deposit funds

💳 Withdraw funds with validation (no overdrafts)

🔄 Menu system with continuous loop until exit

💲 Currency formatting ($1000.00) for professional output

🛠️ Concepts Demonstrated

Loops → menu navigation and repeated user interaction

Conditionals → validating withdrawals and handling invalid choices

Functions → modular design (deposit(), withdraw(), check_balance(), show_history())

Lists → storing transaction history

String formatting → displaying balances with $ and two decimal places

🌱 Future Improvements

🔐 Add PIN authentication

🗂 Save transaction history to a file (JSON/CSV)

📊 Export reports for account activity

🖥 GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt
